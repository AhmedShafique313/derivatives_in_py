# Lets start our code of derivative in python 

# lets consider we have function f(a) = 3a
# if we take derivative of f(a) then we get d(f(a))/da = d(3a)/da = 3.1= 3

# derivative 
a = input("Enter the value of a: ")
a= float(a)
# checking order of function 
cons = 3
func = cons * a
diff = a / a
derivative = cons*diff
print("Derivative of f(a) = ", derivative)

# lets plot f(a) = 3a
